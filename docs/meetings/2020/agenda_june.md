# Agenda 

1. DAWG 
- Data Analysis Working Group is group of SuperDARN international scientists, engineers, and software developers developing analysis software, i.e., [RST](https://github.com/superdarn/rst)
- They have proposed (and accepted?) adding pyDARN into the DAWG group to help ensure the longivity of pyDARN
- What does this mean for pyDARNers? 
    - Marina Schmidt is still the leader/main developer
    - You are not obligated to develop or help with RST 
    - We will have meetings jointly with them to help with high level topics
    - People are not required to stay for the RST bits of meetings 
    - pyDARN probably will still hold its own meetings for specific problems 
- Recommendations: 
    - I encourage all team members of pyDARN to sign up on the DAWG mailing list. Please note the mailing list is used spareling so you will not be spammed with this. It will just help organize high level meetings 
    - You will also be invited to DAWG-internal private repo which will be a nice holding place for pyDARN internal documentation :) 

2. IO in pyDARN:
- Seperate, yes or no?
- When to seperate? 
- Name of the IO package? 

3. Development process
- How to manage projects, tasks, workflow, PR, and issues? 
- Release guidelines
- Any other comments/suggestions? 

4. Future directions
